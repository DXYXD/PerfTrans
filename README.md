summer research

## 7/12/2019
### Reported
1. Created piece relations
2. Standard midi file

### New staff
1. Find the cause why duration in audi is shorter than that in lab
- compute the envelope of intensity
- notice the 'normal' notes and 'outliers'
2. Beat phenomena: 
- find the beat frequency of keys of the piano with more than one strings
- compare the frequency with data in records

3. Match
- Compare all experiment midi file with the standard midifile
- Match notes, generate relations and figures(like the form in cubase) to examine the match algorithm
- Calcualte variance of notes' velocity and duration
